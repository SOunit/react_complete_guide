# what is testing?

- we use both all the time
- manual testing
- automated testing

# categories of tests

- unit test

  - focus on small unit of code
  - a lot of tests
  - the most important

- integration test

  - test combination
  - number is less than unit test

- End-to-End (e2e) test

# what and how

- what

  - focused test, easy to get why in error
  - rather than big test, difficult to locate the reason for error

- how
  - use test tools

# tools

- `jest` - running test and evaluate the result
- `react testing library` - simulate rendering

# how to write test

- same directory with component your testing
- `3A`s `Arrange`, `Act`, `Assert`
- `Arrange` - setup the test data, test conditions and test environment
- `Act` - run logic to be tested
- `Assert` - compare execution result
